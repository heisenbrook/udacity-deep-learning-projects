### Second project - CNN - Algorithms for landmark classification

In the very first part of this project, you will create a CNN that classifies landmarks. You must create your CNN from scratch (so, you can't use transfer learning yet!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 50%.

Although 50% may seem low at first glance, it seems more reasonable after realizing how difficult of a problem this is. Many times, an image that is taken at a landmark captures a fairly mundane image of an animal or plant, like in the following picture.

Just by looking at that image alone, would you have been able to guess that it was taken at the HaleakalƒÅ National Park in Hawaii?

An accuracy of 50% is significantly better than random guessing, which would provide an accuracy of just 2% (100% / 50 classes). In Step 2 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to greatly improve accuracy by using transfer learning to create a CNN.

Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, training strategies, and trust your intuition. And, of course, have fun!

The second part of this task will involve transfer learning. Let's see how hard it is to match that performance with transfer learning.

The third and last part will be about building a simple app that uses our exported model

Go to a search engine for images (like Google Images) and search for images of some of the landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, Machu Picchu and so on. Save a few examples locally, then upload them to your app to see how your model behaves!

The app will show the top 5 classes that the model think are most relevant for the picture you have uploaded

For more instructions on how to deploy this app as a website using Binder:

or you can run the notebook ``app.ipynb`` as a standalone app on your computer by following these steps:

1. Download this notebook in a directory on your machine
2. Download the model export (for example, ``checkpoints/transfer_exported.pt``) in a subdirectory called ``checkpoints`` within the directory where you save the ``app.ipynb`` notebook
3. Install voila if you don't have it already (``pip install voila``)
4. Run your app: ``voila app.ipynb --show_tracebacks=True``
