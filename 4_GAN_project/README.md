### Fourth project - Face generation with GAN

In this project, you'll define and train a Generative Adverserial network of your own creation on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from defining new architectures training adversarial networks. At the end you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise. You can find them in ``/generated_images`` repo

1. Get the Data
You'll be using the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to train your adversarial networks. This dataset has higher resolution images than datasets you have previously worked with (like MNIST or SVHN) you've been working with, and so, you should prepare to define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training.

2. Pre-processed Data
Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done some pre-processing. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images.

The archive containing the images has been splitted into smaller archives and are available in ``/archives`` repo.
