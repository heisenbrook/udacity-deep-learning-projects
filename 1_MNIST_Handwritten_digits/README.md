### First Project - MNIST Handwritten digits recognition

Some of the benchmark results on MNIST include can be found on Yann LeCun's page and include:

88% Lecun et al., 1998

95.3% Lecun et al., 1998

99.65% Ciresan et al., 2011

MNIST is a great dataset for sanity checking your models, since the accuracy levels achieved by large convolutional neural networks and small linear models are both quite high. This makes it important to be familiar with the data.

In this project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the MNIST dataset.
