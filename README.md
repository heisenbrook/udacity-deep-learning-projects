## Projects from Udacity deep learning course


### First project - MNIST Handwritten digits

In the first project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the MNIST dataset.


### Second project - CNN - Algorithms for landmark classification

The second project is from the CNN part of the course and it is about writing an algorithm for landmark classification.

The very first assignment is to design and train a CNN from scratch and get a test accuracy of at least 50%.

The second assignment is to use transfer learning and compare the results with the first assignment.

The third and last part will be about building a simple interactive app with the exported model.

### Third project - Text Translation and Sentiment Analysis using Transformers

The objective of this project is to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews in three different languages - English, French, and Spanish of 3 different datasets, using a pretrained model.

The output of the project will be a CSV file with a header row that includes column names such as **Title**, **Year**, **Synopsis**, **Review**, **Review Sentiment**, and **Original Language**. The Original Language column will indicate the language of the review and synopsis (*en/fr/sp*) before translation. The dataframe will consist of 30 rows, with each row corresponding to a movie.

### Fourth project - Face generation with GAN

This project is about defining and training a Generative Adverserial network on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate and save new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.
