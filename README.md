## Projects from Udacity deep learning course


### First project - MNIST Handwritten digits

In the first project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the MNIST dataset.


### Second project - CNN - Algorithms for landmark classification

The second project is from the CNN part of the course and it is about writing an algorithm for landmark classification.

The very first assignment is to design and train a CNN from scratch and get a test accuracy of at least 50%.

The second assignment is to use transfer learning and compare the results with the first assignment.

The third and last part will be about building a simple interactive app with the exported model.
